# SHIELD-Entity-List

This github repository will contain lists of Entities that have been approved by The Director of SHIELD. These can be suggested Entities or custom ones. Please note that if you did submit a suggestion Entity, the Entities "Classification" number could be changed. For example: You could have suggested the number as A-1234, and it might be changed to A-4321.



Here is a list of classes that may help with understanding of the threat levels of the Entities:


**Classifications:**
**THERE ARE 8 CLASSIFICATIONS**

**Secured (safe)**
Secured Anomalies are Anomalies that are very easy to contain, or very easily protected.

**Undetermined (euclid)**
Undermined Anomalies are Anomalies that are not studied to the point where we know what they are capable of. 

**Pernicious (Keter)**
Pernicious Anomalies are anomalies that are hard to contain and destructive anomalies. 
SECONDARY ANOMALIES

**Bulwark (Thaumiel)**
Bulwark Anomalies are anomalies used to contain other anomalies that have escaped containment. 

**Cataclysm (Apollyon)**
Cataclysm Anomalies are anomalies that can end the world very easily. Starting multiple events ranging from XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario or an HK-Class Deific Subjugation Scenario.

**Decimated (Neutralized)**
Decimated Anomalies are anomalies that have been neutralized in an event of a containment breach or in an event of a termination proposal being accepted.  

**Determined (Explained)**
Determined Anomalies are anomalies that have been fully studied to the point where there is nothing more to learn about them and to the point where it is very easy to recontain or to contain them.

**Disregarded (Archon)**
Disregarded Anomalies are anomalies that are best to be not contained and left in the wild or where they are.
